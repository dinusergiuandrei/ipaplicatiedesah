	This project is a University project in form of a Chess Application.

	The libraries used in creating the project are SDL, SDL_image and SDL_mixer.

	The Chess Application has three main uses.

	1. The Player vs Player mode
		
		In this mode two players play against each other on the board.
		All chess rules are applied during the match, including castles, en-passant and promotion.		

	2. The Player vs Computer mode
		
		In this mode the user is able to select color of play and Computer Strenght, which varies from
		
		-"Beginner" ( For Players with less experience, learning how pieces move across the board ), 
		
		-"Intermediate" ( For more experienced players. The Computer makes much better moves, avoids
		 losing pieces and has little understanding of piece activity, posing problems for the player )
		 
		-"Advanced" ( For players used to competitive chess competitions. The computer has deep understanding
		of the position, making moves that are tactical and strategical correct. In this mode the computer
		enters the "Deep Calculation Mode", taking on avarage 30 to 40 seconds per move, faster than a 
		human's calculation in competitive chess )

		This mode is useful for Training, checking play level or just for fun.		

	3. The Demonstration mode
	
		In this mode two chess engines can play against each other.

		The user first chooses the level for each engine before starting the match.
		The possible levels are "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced".
		
		This mode is useful in seeing the strenght difference between engines.
